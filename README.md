# Python_NumPy-Crypto-Analysis
Python library for fetching and analyzing crypto prices using NumPy.


This project helps you understand and analyze cryptocurrency prices using Python. It uses a powerful tool called NumPy to crunch numbers and give you insights into daily crypto data.

What This Program Does

Think of this as a small tool to explore crypto market trends. Here's what it can do:

  Shows Daily Prices & Quantities: It starts with a set of example daily prices and how much crypto was traded each day for a month.
  Organizes Data: It can rearrange the daily prices into 10-day blocks, making it easier to see trends over shorter periods.
  Calculates Totals: You'll see the total amount of crypto traded and the total value (in dollars) of all trades for the entire month.
  Finds Highs and Lows: For each 10-day period, it tells you the lowest and highest prices the crypto reached.
  Calculates Averages: It can show you the average price over the last 5 days for the recent days, which helps spot trends.
  Sorts Prices: You can see all the daily prices arranged from lowest to highest. It even shows you how to sort them both with NumPy (super fast!) and manually (just for demonstration).

How to Run It

This program is very simple to run!

  Save the Code: Make sure you have the Python code saved in a file, for example, crypto_analysis.py.
  Open Your Terminal: This is like a command window on your computer.
      On Windows, search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell."
      On Mac/Linux, search for "Terminal."
  Go to the Right Folder: Use the cd command to navigate to where you saved the file. For example, if it's in your "Documents" folder, you might type cd Documents.
  Run the Program: Once you're in the correct folder, type:
  Bash

  python crypto_analysis.py

  Then, press Enter.

The program will run and print all the analysis directly in your terminal. There's no interactive menu; it just runs through all the calculations and shows you the results.
What You Need

You only need Python 3 installed on your computer. The program uses the numpy library, which is a standard part of data analysis in Python. If you don't have it, you can install it using pip:
Bash

pip install numpy

Feel free to explore the code to see how each calculation is done!
